# NeedForHeat P1-BASE hardware 

This repository contains the open hardware design files for the NeedForHeeat NeedForHeat P1-BASE device, which can be used as a [CoreInk BASE extension module](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/coreink/proto_base), below an [M5Stack CoreInk]([https://github.com/LilyGO/ESP32-MINI-32-V1.3](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/coreink)) device.. 

The NeedForHeat P1-BASE enables reading [smart meters that adhere to the Dutch Smart Meter Requirements](https://github.com/energietransitie/dsmr-info).

## General info
This repository contains the open hardware designs files for the NeedForHeat P1-BASE. It also includes a `docs` folder with recent printouts of the [schematics](./docs/needforheat-p1-base-hardware-sch.pdf) and [PCB layout](./docs/needforheat-p1-base-hardware-pcb.pdf). 

For the associated firmware that you can run on this device, please see [this repository](https://github.com/energietransitie/needforheat-p1-reader-firmware).

## Producing


### Printed Circuit Board
To fabricate the printed circuit board you can use various PCB services. 

The folder [pcb/jlcpcb](./pcb/jlcpcb) includes all exported files needed to have the PCBs manufactured by [JLCPCB](https://www.jlcpcb.com). Upload the [zipped gerber files](./pcb/jlcpcb/assembly/GERBER-needforheat-p1-base-hardware.zip) to the [JLCPCB quote page](https://cart.jlcpcb.com/quote), select the amount of PCBs and a colour for the silkscreen. All other options can be left on default.  If SMT assembly is desired, also select this option before ordering. This will take you to a page where the BOM and POS file can be uploaded. Use the files [BOM-needforheat-p1-base-hardware.csv](./pcb/jlcpcb/assembly/BOM-needforheat-p1-base-hardware.csv) and [CPL-needforheat-p1-base-hardware.csv](./pcb/jlcpcb/assembly/CPL-needforheat-p1-base-hardware.csv).

### Enclosure
To fabricate the enclosure you can use your own 3D printer or use a 3D printing service. 

<img src="./images/enclosure.jpg" height="600" />

The folder [enclosure/fabrication](./enclosure/fabrication) contains exported STL files for the [case](./enclosure/fabrication/twomes-hardware-repository-template-case.stl) and [lid](./enclosure/twomes-hardware-repository-template-lid.step) of the NeedForHeat P1-BASE enclosure. The STL files can be imported into any slicer and turned into G-Code for a 3D printer.

## Developing
### Printed Circuit Board
To change the hardware design of the PCB, you need:
* [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/download/) installed to change te PCB design. 

The KiCad source files of the PCB can be found in the folder [pcb](./pcb).

To convert the PCBs into a format suitable for fabrication, consult the webpage of your PCB manufacturer of choice. For example, see the [JLCPCB guide on how to export Gerbers](https://support.jlcpcb.com/article/149-how-to-generate-gerber-and-drill-files-in-kicad) and the  [JLCPCB guide how to export the BOM and POS files](https://support.jlcpcb.com/article/84-how-to-generate-the-bom-and-centroid-file-from-kicad). You may also use a KiCad plug-in for this purpose such as [kicad-jlcpcb-tools](https://github.com/Bouni/kicad-jlcpcb-tools).

<!-- 
### Enclosure
To change the hardware design of the enclosure, you need either:
* [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.kicad.org/download/) installed (Autodesk provides 30 day free trials and [free one-year educational access](https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview?sorting=featured&filters=individual) to its products and services for eligible students, teachers and research staff); 
* or [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/), an open source alternative.

The source files of the enclosure can be found in the folder [enclosure](./enclosure). We include both .f3d source files and .step source files we obtained after conversion.
